    "# Sample code to demonstrate the use of *K-Prototype* for clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most well known clustering method used today is K-Means. However, this approach works essentially with numerical data. As it tries to group data points around potential cluster centers, it needs to compute the distances between the points and the centers. If these points contain categorical data such as animal preference ['horse', 'cat','bird','dog','fish'] for example, it becomes very difficult to assign a weight to this type of feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here comes K-Prototype to the rescue and helps you to find clusters in spite of the mix of numerical and categorical data. It doesn't work always exceptionally well but it is a neat method to keep in your toolbox.\n"

    "Since the algorithm **K-Prototype** also computes distances (a la Kmeans), it is preferrable to scale the portion of the data that is numerical so one feature doesn't prevail on another one. This being said, one interesting approach could be to perform a pre-selection of the most important features to reduce the dimension of our data set and makes things faster. This is not particularly difficult to develop but beyond the scope of what we want to demonstrate."
